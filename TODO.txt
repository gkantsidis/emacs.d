Things to do:

1. Predictive-mode does not seem to work.
 This is downloaded from a separate git inside extra/predictive.
 
 2. preview-latex does not seem to work (preview-latex.el does not exist in auctex)
 
3. latex-preview-pane not working
 We downloaded both from melpa and from git (in extra)
 Disabled in init-latex
 
4. Check that all minor modes for latex are enabled correctly.

5. Add emacs to windows explorer context menu
